# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/), which will be attempted in the Rust programming language, which I am still in the process of learning. I only just found out about this a couple of months ago!

## Solutions

All solutions linked below:
| Day | Title | Part A | Part B | SFS | Result |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| 01 | Calorie Counting    | | | [`main.rs`](./day01/src/main.rs) | :star2: :star2: |
| 02 | Rock Paper Scissors | [02a](./day02a/src/main.rs) | [02b](./day02b/src/main.rs) | | :star2: :star2: |

## Notes

1. Now that I have a better understanding of how this event is run, I may start uploading single file solutions from this point on if I have time to refactor part A for part B. For solutions that are split in two, I will go back and refactor to a single file, and archive the originals.
