# :gift::christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2022 :christmas_tree::sparkles:

These are my solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/), which will be attempted in the Rust programming language, which I am still in the process of learning. I only just found out about this a couple of months ago!

## Solutions

All solutions linked below:

## Notes

1. Now that I have a better understanding of how this event is run, I may start uploading single file solutions from this point on, but I may still keep them split so I can have separate comments for both parts. Instead what I'll do is refactor part B to give answers to both parts where I can. Instances of part B that do not combine both answers will have a lighter background.
1. Day 05 was torture because of that parsing. Clearly something to work on. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zd1hqy/2022_day_5_i_know_i_am_overthinking_it/) meme was me.
