# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/), which will be attempted in the Rust programming language, which I am still in the process of learning. I only just found out about this a couple of months ago!

## Solutions

All solutions linked below:
| Day | Title | Part A | Part B | Result |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| [01](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) | Calorie Counting    | [01a](./day01a/src/main.rs) | [01b](./day01b/src/main.rs) | :star::star: |
| [02](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) | Rock Paper Scissors | [02a](./day02a/src/main.rs) | [`02b`](./day02b/src/main.rs) | :star::star: |

## Notes

1. Now that I have a better understanding of how this event is run, I may start uploading single file solutions from this point on, but I may still keep them split so I can have separate comments for both parts. Instead what I'll do is refactor part B to give answers to both parts where I can. Instances of part B that do not combine both answers will have a lighter background.
