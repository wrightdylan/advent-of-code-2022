# :gift::christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2022 :christmas_tree::sparkles:

These are my solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/), which will be attempted in the Rust programming language, which I am still in the process of learning. I only just found out about this a couple of months ago!

## Notes

1. Now that I have a better understanding of how this event is run, I may start uploading single file solutions from this point on, but I may still keep them split so I can have separate comments for both parts. Instead what I'll do is refactor part B to give answers to both parts where I can. Instances of part B that do not combine both answers will have a lighter background.
1. Day 05 was torture because of that parsing. Clearly something to work on. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zd1hqy/2022_day_5_i_know_i_am_overthinking_it/) meme was me.
1. Day 08 - a little point to bear in mind for future puzzles: be sure to read the example **very** *carefully* :man_facepalming:. You can save a lot of time that way, instead of wondering why the code isn't working :skull_and_crossbones:.
1. Some days I just don't have the time :hourglass:.
1. Day 15b could have been completed on time, but I really didn't want to brute force this but instead look for a more elegant solution. I've figured one out, but I will have to come back to that another time since Day 16 has been released.
1. Day 18 was such a beautiful day, the first time this month. It seemed like a real waste not to go out all day.
